    After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, 
    modern Nepal was unified in the latter half of the 18th century, when Prithvi Narayan Shah, the ruler
     of the small principality of Gorkha, formed a unified country from a number of independent hill high 
     states. After the death of Prithvi Narayan Shah, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into 
     much of the Indian subcontinent. Between 1788 and 1791, during the Sino-Nepalese War, Nepal invaded 
     Tibet and robbed Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse. Alarmed, the Qianlong Emperor of the Chinese Qing
      Dynasty appointed Fuk'anggan commander-in-chief of the Tibetan campaign; Fuk'anggan signed a treaty
       to protect his troops thus attaining a draw.

    After 1800, the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over 
    Nepal. A period of internal turmoil followed. The rivalry between Nepal and the British East India 
    Company over the princely states bordering Nepal and British-India eventually led to the 
    Anglo-Nepalese War

    <h2>Shah dynasty</h2>
    The Kingdom of Nepal , also known as the Gorkha Empire  or Asal Hindustan Real Land of the Hindus,
     was a Hindu kingdom in South Asia, formed in 1768, by the unification of Nepal.Founded by 
     King Prithvi Narayan Shah, a Gorkha monarch who claimed to be of Khas Thakuri origin,
    it existed for 240 years until the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy in 2008. During this period,
     Nepal was formally under the rule of the Shah dynasty, which exercised varying degrees of power 
   during the kingdom's existence.In July 1950, the newly independent Republic of India signed a friendship treaty in which both nations agreed to respect the other's sovereignty. In November of
         the same year, India played an important role in supporting King Tribhuvan, whom the Rana leader
          Mohan Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana had attempted to depose and replace with his infant grandson
           who would later become King Gyanendra. With Indian support for a new government consisting 
           largely of the Nepali Congress, King Tribhuvan ended the Rana regime in 1951.<br><hr>
 <h2>Rana dynasty</h2>
 Rana dynasty,  was a Chhetri dynasty that imposed totalitarianism in the Kingdom of Nepal from 1846 until
  1951, reducing the Shah monarch to a figurehead and making Prime Minister and other government positions
   held by the Ranas hereditary. They claimed Kshatriya status themselves.
    Rana dynasty is historically known for the iron-fisted rule.
    <img class="img" src="./photo/Jung-Bahadur-Rana.webp" width="200" height="180">This changed after the Revolution of 1951 with the promulgation of a new constitution, when power 
     shifted back to the monarchy of King Tribhuvan.
The Rana dynasty descended from the Kunwar family, a nobility of the Gorkha Kingdom.
 Due to the marital lineages with the politically reigning Thapa dynasty (of Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa) 
 from early 19th century, Ranas gained entry to central Darbar politics. Ranas were also linked to 
 a minor faction of the Pande dynasty of Gorkha through the Thapa dynasty. 
 hronicler Daniel Wright has published the genealogy of Jang Bahadur Kunwar Rana. 
 The genealogy begins with Tattā Rāṇā as Raja (King) of Chittaurgarh.
  His nephew Fakht Siṃha Rāṇā had a son named Rāma Siṃha Rāṇā, who came to hills after the siege of 
  Chittaur. He was employed by a hill Raja for ten or twelve months who wanted to retain Rāma Siṃha in his
   country. The hill Raja asked for the daughter of Raja of Bīnātī, a Bagāle Kṣetrī and married her to 
   Rāma Siṃha. They had six sons over 10–12 years, one of whom was recognized by the title of Kum̐vara 
   Khaḍkā for bravery displayed in the battle against Raja of Satān Koṭ. The title was used by his descendants. 
   Rāma Siṃha was suddenly met by his younger brother who requested him to return Chittaur for once and
    Rāma Siṃha died reaching there.[13] The hill Raja made Rāma Siṃha's son Rāut Kunwar a nobleman (Sardār)
     and commandant of the army.<br><br><hr>
     <h2>Democracy in Nepal</h2>
  <img class="img" src="./photo/demos.jpg" width="200" height="200">
     The Nepalese democracy movement was the combination of a series of political initiatives and
      movements from the 20th century to 2008 that advocated the establishment of representative democracy,
a multi-party political system and the abolition of monarchy in Nepal. It has seen three major movements, 
the Revolution of 1951, Jana Andolan and Loktantra Andolan  which ultimately abolished the Shah monarchy, 
transitioned Nepal towards a republic and reintroduced multi-party bicameral democracy.
The beginning of a national movement for democracy in Nepal was the ousting of the Ranas, the 
long-established Nepalese royal family, in the mid-20th century which was influenced by ethnic and
 political developments from the Indian nationalist movement. However, this period of democracy 
 ended in 1960 and the Panchayat system of government was introduced, abolishing recent democratic 
 institutions, banning political parties and restricting some forms of freedom of speech.<hr>
