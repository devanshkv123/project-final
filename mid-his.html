    In the 11th century, a powerful empire of Khas people emerged in western Nepal whose
     territory at its highest peak included much of western Nepal as well as parts of western 
     Tibet and Uttarakhand of India. By the 14th century, the empire had splintered into loosely 
     associated Baise rajyas, literally 22 states as they were counted. The rich culture and language
      of the Khas people spread throughout Nepal and as far as Indo-China in the intervening centuries;
       their language, later renamed the Nepali language, became the lingua franca of Nepal as well as 
       much of North-east India. In south-eastern Nepal, Simraungarh annexed Mithila around 1100 AD, and 
       the unified Tirhut stood as a powerful kingdom for more than 200 years,[1] even ruling over
        Kathmandu for a time. After another 300 years of Muslim rule, Tirhut came under the control
         of the Sens of Makawanpur.[1] In the eastern hills, a confederation of Kirat principalities 
         ruled the area between Kathmandu and Bengal.<br><br>

    In the Kathmandu valley, the Mallas had established themselves in Kathmandu and Patan by the
     middle of the 14th century. The Mallas ruled the valley first under the suzerainty of Tirhut 
     but established independent reign by late 14th century as Tirhut went into decline. In the late 
     14th century, Jayasthiti Malla introduced widespread socio-economic reforms, principal of which 
     was the caste system. By dividing the indigenous non-Aryan Buddhist population into castes modelled 
     after the four Varna system of Hinduism, he provided an influential model for the Sanskritization
      and Hinduization of the indigenous non-Hindu tribal populations in all principalities throughout 
      Nepal. By the middle of the 15th century, Kathmandu had become a powerful empire which, according
       to Kirkpatrick, extended from Digarchi or Sigatse in Tibet to Tirhut and Gaya in India. In the late
        15th century, Malla princes divided their kingdom in four – Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur in the 
        valley and Banepa to the east. The competition for prestige among these brotherly kingdoms saw the
         flourishing of art and architecture in central Nepal, and the building of famous Kathmandu, Patan 
         and Bhaktapur Durbar Squares; their division and mistrust led to their fall in the late 18th 
         century, and ultimately, the unification of Nepal into a modern state

    <p class="tittle"><h2>Malla Dynasty</h2></p>
    <img class="midpicture" src="./photo/Bhaskar_Malla.jpg" width="200" height="200">
    The Malla dynasty Nepali was the ruling dynasty of the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal from 1201 to 1779.
     They were a Raghuvanshi dynasty who were seen as the descendants of the Licchavi dynasty. Later Malla
      kings also traced one section of their lineage from Nanyadeva, the founder of the Karnat dynasty of 
      Mithila.The term malla means wrestler in Sanskrit. The first use of the word malla in the Kathmandu 
      Valley begins from 1201. The Malla period was a golden one that stretched over 600 years, as they 
      presided over and flourished the Newar civilization of Nepal Mandala which developed as one of the 
      most sophisticated urban civilisation in the Himalayan foothills and a key destination in the
       India-Tibet trade route.<br><br><br>
       Clockwise from top-left:
        (a) Kathmandu Durbar Square, the Royal palace of Malla King of Kantipur 
        (b) Patan Durbar Square, the Royal palace of Malla King of Patan
        (c) Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the Royal palace of Malla King of Bhaktapur, 
        as they all looked during 1850s.
        Beginning in the early twelfth century, leading notables in Nepal began to appear with 
        names ending in the term malla, ("wrestler" in Sanskrit), indicating a person of great 
        strength and power. Arimalla (reigned 1200–16) was the first king to be so called, and 
        the practice of adopting such a name was followed regularly by rulers in Nepal until the 
        eighteenth century. 
        The names of the Malla kings were also written as, for example, Ari Malla. 
        Another legend says that Arimalla was fond of wrestling and he added malla to his name. However,
         this is debated as the word malla appears frequently in the historical records prior the Malla 
         dynasty.<br><hr>
         <p class="tittle"><h2>Sen Dynasty</h2></p>
         <img class="midpicture" src="./Sena_Empire_Coat_of_Arms.jpg" width="200" height="200">
         The rulers of the Sena dynasty claim to belong to the lunar race. 
         They were settled in Bengal as a ruling dynasty. With the attack of Muhammad ibn Bakhtyar
          Khilji in AD 1202, the rule of King Lakshmanasena, the last ruler of Bengal of this dynasty,
           ended. The rulers of Sena dynasty, after their decline in Bengal in AD 1205, appeared in the 
           land of Nepal and established the kingdom of Makawanpur during the thirteenth or fourteenth 
           century. The kingdom of Makawanpur was subjugated by the then rising political power of 
           Gorkhalis in AD 1762. In the Senas’ rule, the nature of administration was centralised,
            though there were judicial, district and local administrative units. Besides, 
            the influence of Mughal administration is clearly seen in the administration 
            during the Senas’ rule. It is said that the historical study of administrative
             posts during the Sena period is essential to understand the present-day administration
              of Nepal.<hr>
